# Wilcoxon Tests for Hypothesis Testing

Using ``wilcoxon`` and ``ranksums`` from **scipy.stats** for performing Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test and Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test respectvely.

## Content

Our main resource is the Jupyter Notebook named [Wilcoxon Tests.ipynb](https://github.com/Lacerdash/Hypothesis-Testing-Confidence-Interval/blob/main/Wilcoxon%20Tests/Wilcoxon%20Tests.ipynb), which includes:

- Detailed explanations of the **Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test** and **Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test**.
- Step-by-step guidance on how to perform these tests in Python.
- Comprehensive interpretation of test results including p-values.
- Practical examples using real-world data sets.

## Objectives

This notebook aims to:

- Demonstrate the use of non-parametric approaches to hypothesis testing, specifically in scenarios where the assumptions for parametric tests (like paired t-test and two-sample t-test) are not met.
- Provide a hands-on approach to learning by pratical examples
