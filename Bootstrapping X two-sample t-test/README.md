# Bootstrapping for Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals

Using ``numpy`` for performing Bootstrapping for Hypothesis testing and Building Confidence Intervals.

## Description

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook named [Bootstrapping X two-sample t-test.ipynb](https://github.com/Lacerdash/Hypothesis-Testing-C.I/blob/main/Bootstrapping/Bootstrapping%20X%20two-sample%20t-test.ipynb) that focuses on:

- **When to use Bootstrap approach**
- **Bootstrap Hypothesis Testing X Two-sample t-test**
- **Bootstrap for Building Confdidence Intervals**

The notebook explores the concepts and techniques related to hypothesis testing and confidence intervals with bootstrapping. It covers topics such as:

- Confidence intervals estimation
- Hypothesis testing for difference in 2 means
- Interpreting p-values and making conclusions
