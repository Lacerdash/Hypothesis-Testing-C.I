# Permutation for Hypothesis Testing

Using ``numpy`` for performing Bootstrapping for Hypothesis testing and Building Confidence Intervals.

## Description

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook named [Permutation.ipynb](https://github.com/Lacerdash/Hypothesis-Testing-Confidence-Interval/blob/main/Permuatation%20Hypohesis%20Testing/Permutation.ipynb) that focuses on:

- **When to use Permutation approach**
- **Drawbacks of Permutation**
- **Permutation for Hypothesis Testing**

The notebook explores the concepts and techniques related to hypothesis testing with permutation. It covers topics such as:

- Hypothesis testing for difference in 2 means
- Interpreting p-values and making conclusions
