# Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals

This repository provides resources and code examples related to Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals using various techniques, including ``two-sample t-test`` and ``bootstrapping``.

## Description

The repository is organized into the following folders:

  - **Descriptive statistic:** Exploratory analysis with plots and summary statistics.
  - **Inferencial Statistic:** Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals.
- [Bootstrapping X two-sample t-test:](https://github.com/Lacerdash/Hypothesis-Testing-C.I/tree/main/Bootstrapping)
  - **When to use Bootstrap Approach** 
  - **Bootstrap Hypothesis Testing vs. Two-sample t-test**
  - **Bootstrap for Building Confidence Intervals** 
- [Permutations:](https://github.com/Lacerdash/Hypothesis-Testing-C.I/tree/main/Permutation)
