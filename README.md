# Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals

Welcome to my study corner dedicated to Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals. This repository serves as a personal knowledge base where I compile and share coding examples that I've used in my learning journey. The main techniques explored in these examples include ``Two-sample t-test``, ``Bootstrapping``, ``Permuation``, ``Wilcoxon Tests`` and ``ANOVA``.

## Description

The repository is organized into the following folders:

- [Two-sample t-test:](https://github.com/Lacerdash/Hypothesis-Testing-Confidence-Interval/tree/main/Two-sample%20t-test)
  - **Descriptive statistic:** Exploratory analysis with plots and summary statistics.
  - **Inferencial Statistic:** Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals.
- [Bootstrapping X two-sample t-test:](https://github.com/Lacerdash/Hypothesis-Testing-Confidence-Interval/tree/main/Bootstrapping%20X%20two-sample%20t-test)
  - **Bootstrap Hypothesis Testing vs. Two-sample t-test**
  - **Bootstrap for Building Confidence Intervals** 
  - **When to use Bootstrap Approach** 
- [Permutations:](https://github.com/Lacerdash/Hypothesis-Testing-Confidence-Interval/tree/main/Permuatation%20Hypohesis%20Testing)
  - **Permutation for Hypothesis Testing**
  - **When to use Permutation Approach** 
- [Wilcoxon Tests:](https://github.com/Lacerdash/Hypothesis-Testing-Confidence-Interval/tree/main/Wilcoxon%20Test)
  - **Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test and Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test**
  - **When to use Wilcoxon Tests**
- [Anova]() Still studying it
  - One Way Anova (ANOVA)

In addition, the repository also includes a recommended YouTube playlist for an in-depth understanding of these statistical concepts:
