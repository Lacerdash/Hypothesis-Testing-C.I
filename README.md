# Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals

This repository provides resources and code examples related to Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals using various techniques, including ``two-sample t-test``, ``bootstrapping``, ``permuation`` and ``ANOVA``.

## Description

The repository is organized into the following folders:

- [Two-sample t-test:](https://github.com/Lacerdash/Hypothesis-Testing-Confidence-Interval/tree/main/Two-sample%20t-test)
  - **Descriptive statistic:** Exploratory analysis with plots and summary statistics.
  - **Inferencial Statistic:** Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals.
- [Bootstrapping X two-sample t-test:](https://github.com/Lacerdash/Hypothesis-Testing-Confidence-Interval/tree/main/Bootstrapping%20X%20two-sample%20t-test)
  - **When to use Bootstrap Approach** 
  - **Bootstrap Hypothesis Testing vs. Two-sample t-test**
  - **Bootstrap for Building Confidence Intervals** 
- [Permutations:](https://github.com/Lacerdash/Hypothesis-Testing-Confidence-Interval/tree/main/Permuatation%20Hypohesis%20Testing)
  - **When to use Permutation Approach** 
  - **Permutation for Hypothesis Testing**
- [Anova]()
  - One Way Anova (ANOVA)

Additionally, the repository includes a curated playlist on YouTube that covers these statistical concepts:
