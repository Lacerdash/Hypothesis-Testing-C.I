# Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals

This repository provides resources and code examples related to Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals using various techniques, including two-sample t-test and bootstrapping.

## Description

The repository is organized into the following folders:

- [Two-sample t-test:](https://github.com/Lacerdash/Hypothesis-Testing-C.I/blob/main/Exploratory%20Analysis.ipynb)
  - **Descriptive statistic:** Exploratory analysis with plots and summary statistics.
  - **Inferencial Statistic:** Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals.
- [Bootstrapping X two-sample t-test:](https://github.com/Lacerdash/Hypothesis-Testing-C.I/blob/main/Exploratory%20Analysis.ipynb)
  - **When to use Bootstrap Approach:** Understanding the situations where bootstrapping is applicable.
  - **Bootstrap Hypothesis Testing vs. Two-sample t-test:** Comparing and contrasting the two approaches.
  - **Bootstrap for Building Confidence Intervals:** Using bootstrapping to construct confidence intervals.

Additionally, the repository includes a curated playlist on YouTube that covers these statistical concepts:
